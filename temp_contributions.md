I worked primarily on the `1-intro_exploration.ipynb` notebook, where I used the cleaned data from Peter to create EDA charts and explore correlations. I continued exploring correlations in `2-finding-associations.ipynb` to generate a correlation map for the selected BAP features. I also modularized some of the EDA code into functions to make it easier for my team to reuse and extend. Additionally, I saved all visualizations in the visualizations folder and the processed data in the data folder for easy access and reusability across notebooks. Finally, I updated the environment.yml file based on the imports I used and tested the environment to ensure all notebooks I worked on run smoothly.
